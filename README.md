Premier League Points Projection Model
This project leverages Python and machine learning to predict the total points each Premier League team will accumulate by the end of the season. The model is based on last season statistics and provides insights into team performance trends. Visualizations are included to showcase the predicted standings.

Features
The dataset includes the following features:

Team: The Premier League team name.
Matches Played: The total number of matches played so far.
Points: The current points accumulated by the team.
Goals Scored: Total goals scored by the team.
Goals Conceded: Total goals conceded by the team.
Goal Difference: Difference between goals scored and goals conceded.
Wins, Draws, Losses: Breakdown of match results.
Form (Last 5 Matches): Encoded as W=3, D=1, L=0, representing recent team performance.
Projected Points: The predicted points each team will earn after 38 games.
Workflow
1. Data Collection and Preparation
The dataset is created using hypothetical data statistics from the first 10 games of the season. Key features are included to reflect current team performance.

2. Modeling
A Random Forest Regressor is trained to predict the total points for each team based on their current stats. The model is evaluated using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average prediction error.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Highlights larger deviations in predictions.
3. Visualization
The results are visualized using:

Horizontal Bar Chart: Displays teams and their predicted points in descending order.
Residual Plot: Shows the difference between actual and predicted values.
Actual vs Predicted Points Plot: Visual comparison of performance.
Key Visualizations
Projected Points Bar Chart:
Teams are plotted on the y-axis.
Projected points are displayed in Premier League green (#05F04C) with a purple outline (#37003C).
Teams are sorted in descending order of projected points.
